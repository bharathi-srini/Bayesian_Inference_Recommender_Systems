Data used in this project is an open-source dataset provided by Instacart 
[source](https://tech.instacart.com/3-million-instacart-orders-open-sourced-d40d29ead6f2)

This anonymized dataset contains a sample of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users. 
For each user, there are between 4 and 100 of their orders, with the sequence of products purchased in each order. 
Week and hour of day the order was placed, and a relative measure of time between orders is also provided.
